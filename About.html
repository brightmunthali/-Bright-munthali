    <p>"As a driven young entrepreneur, I've had the privilege of working on several exciting projects that showcase my passion for innovation and creativity. One of my notable ventures is co-founding TRELIGHT PODCAST alongside my partner Bright Nyimba, where we've had the opportunity to host talented artists like Trappy Beats and upcoming sensation D-Troy. Through these podcast episodes, we've been able to create a platform for artists to share their stories, showcase their talents, and connect with their fans.Moreover, I was a co-founder of the Backoutsideboyz organization, where I played a key role as a publicist, helping to shape the group's image and message. I've been able to utilize my creativity and skills to develop effective strategies that have helped increase the organization's online presence and reputation.
